I've created some synthetic data (attached); to get a sense of what
working with this data looks like, please use it to answer these
questions:
 - What's the total charged over this time period?
 - What's the most popular handset model?
 - What is the mean number of balance inquiries per person?
 - What is the mean degree (number of contacts) per person (including
incoming and outgoing calls)?
 - Which person has the largest asymmetry between incoming and outgoing contacts? How asymmetric is it?

Then feel free to do any additional analysis you find interesting; briefly summarize your results.

Please use python (and numpy if you need it).
